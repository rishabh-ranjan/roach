# roach

Per [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach#Hardiness), roaches:
> * are capable of remaining active for a month without food  
> * are able to survive on limited resources  
> * can go without air for 45 minutes  
> * have survived twelve hours at −5 to −8 °C (23 to 18 °F)  
> * are also able to survive decapitation  
> * will "inherit the Earth" if humanity destroys itself in a nuclear war  

Same goes for my experiments.


`roach` is an experiment management framework,
intended primarily for use by me, and close collaborators.
